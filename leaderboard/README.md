Leaderboard Visualization
=============

The Leaderboard visualization needed to show the current leaders in both game play objectives.

First, a leaderboard for the highest barscore. We figured the more people frequented the bar the more drinks they had to be consuming.  Therefore the complicated mathematical equation of:

> high barscore = high level of drunkenness

The second game objective would be to claim all of the Beacons hidden in the club. The party had somewhat of a TRON related theme, so to visualize each beacon we borrowed some nerdtastic TRON symbols.

For both leaderboards we wanted to display the selfies the players had taken with the iOS App and display their player name.

And here is what the end reult looks like:
