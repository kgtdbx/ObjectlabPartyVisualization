# Party App Visualizations

For our party game app we implemented two visualizations to give players a way to show off their game play performance and make not yet participating party guest aware of the game and hopefully entice them to join in.

#### Browser Support

The visualizations featured here have been developed for a controlled environment and have been tested to work with Chrome only. They propbably work with other modern browsers but I havn't tested them. 


#### 'People At The Bar' Visualization

Screen visualizations displaying people who are currently in the bar area

#### 'Leaderboard' Visualization

Leaderboard summary

### D3.js

When it comes to HTML based visualizations the choice is easy. If you have not heard about D3.js, it is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data using HTML, SVG and CSS. For more information check out [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org)
