Visualization
=============

Screen visualizations displaying the leaderboards and bar presence.

Summary:
-------------

We had planned for 2 screens. 

One to visualize people currently in the bar area and welcome newcommers with some kind of callout.

Two a life update of the leaders.

Update player names and photos.

Draw others in to play the game.

Give it a bit of a TRON look.
