# Party App Visualizations

For our party app we implemented 2 visualizations helping to mkae people aware of the game and giving  players a way to show off their game play performance.

When it came to HTML based visualization the choice was easy. We had successfully utilized D3.js for client projects and felt comfortable enough that we would be able to hack up something interesting for this.

If you have not heard about D3.js, it is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data using HTML, SVG and CSS. For more information check out [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org)

## The 'Leaderboard'

We needed an effective way to make people who were at the party, but not yet playing the game, aware of what we had concocted and hopefully entice them to participate.
For those who were already playing the game, we wanted to visualize how they were doing and allow them to share their progress with others. In addition to the information provided through the iOS App UI we needed to display on highly visible screens how many beacons they had claimed and what kind of impressive barscore they had managed to amass. 
Most importantly though we wanted some kind of fun way to visualize micro-location detection and share the selfies people took with the iOS App with the rest of the party crowdâ€¦ 

### Summary:


We had planned for 2 screens. 

One to visualize people currently in the bar area and welcome newcommers with some kind of callout.

Two a life update of the leaders.

Update player names and photos.

Draw others in to play the game.

Give it a bit of a TRON look.
