### The 'People At The Bar' Visualization

We figured the best way to visualize micro-location detection was to simulate typical 'people at the bar' behaviour, to display their mugshot and screen name and attempt to engage them with game related personalized messages. All we needed was an interesting way to mimick people bumping into each other, trying to push through the crowd to order a drink and having a good time.

And here is what we came up with:

![alt text](/img/people-at-bar.jpg "At The Bar Visualization")

People at the bar are visualized as bubbles floating on the screen. New arrivals come bouncing onto the screen from above causing movement and eventually settling down until somebody else arrives. They are greeted with a personalized message displayed as a call-out offering game playing tips or congratulating them on their performance. As more people crowd the space and bump into each other more movement happensâ€¦ you know, kind of typical bar behaviour.

### Fixed Screen Size and Other Settings

To keep things as simple I decided to implement this with a fixed screen size. Our A/V guys provided screens with 1900x1060 resolution so that is what I used. Looking at the source code you will notice several variables being set at the top, `vizWidth` and `vizHeight` are used to set the dimensions of the visualization.

Looking at `margin`, `width` and `height`, note that I am using Mike Bostock's [margin convention](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563).

Others worth mentioning are `radius` which sets the people-bubble radius and `radiusBig`which is the bubble radius when people first arrive on the sreen. After a little while the bubble animates to get reduced the `radius`.

The rest of these should be quite self explanatory after reading the comments.

```javascript
// CONFIGS
var svg, // the svg canvas
	barViz, // the svg group containing the bar visualization
	barCount = 10, // the max amount of people on the screen 
	refreshTime = 7000, // milliseconds between data refresh requests 
	vizWidth = 1900, //1920, // total available screen width
	vizHeight = 1060, //1080, // total available screen height
	margin = {top: 30, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 30}, // margin object
	width =  vizWidth - margin.left - margin.right, // calculated width of visualization
	height = vizHeight - margin.top - margin.bottom, // calculated height of visualization
	padding = 13, // padding between people-bubbles
	animDuration = 2000, // the time it takes to animate a change
	radius = 100, // bubble radius
	radiusBig = 200, // new arrival bubble radius
	textPadding = 22, // the padding between the photo frame and the screen name label
	picFrameWidth = 2, // the stroke-width of the circle border around the photo
	lastLoadedPeople = [], // an array containing the data for most recently loaded people
	peopleOnScreen = [], // an array containing the data for people currently on the screen
	force; // the force layout
```

### New Arrival Messages

Our design specified that we wanted to greet people arriving to the bar with game related personalized messages. The messages should be intelligent enough so they would match a persons current game status in the game.

To keep this somewhat simple I set up several arrays containing message objects, one for each of the following scenarious:

- Newcomers
- Players without a photo
- Players with various bar score levels
- Players with various amounts of beacons collected

To allow for various message formats, each message object contained a greeting, a start and and end-text snippet. Depending on the message type a barscore of beacon count would be inserted between start and end...


```javascript
// CALLOUTS for Newcomers
// does NOT use score
var newcomerSnippets = [
	{
		greeting: 'Hi',
		start: 'Get a drink',
		end: 'to boost your bar score!'
	}, {
		greeting: 'Yo',
		start: 'Find a beacon to play the game!',
		end: ''
	},
	...
			
```




### Constructing a Person

Describe how each bubble is built


### The Animated Layout

To auto-position and animate the people I am using [d3.layout.force](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout#force) which constructs a force-directed layout and does all of the complicated math for us to simulate attraction/repulsion, friction, proximity, charge and gravity along with others. These are all the ingredients needed to accomplish what we need.

```javascript
// configure the force layout
force = d3.layout.force()
	    .nodes(peopleOnScreen)
	    .size([width, height])
	    .gravity(0.005)
	    .charge(-radius*3.5)
	    .on("tick", onForceTick)
	    .start();
```
